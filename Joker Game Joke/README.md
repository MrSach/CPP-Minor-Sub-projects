# Joker Game Joke

Welcome to a very silly practical joke that was inspired by a friend long, long ago.
So long in fact, that I do not even remember exactly how this became funny.
I am not even sure who invented it, but regardless, it is amazing what lengths a pack of playing cards can motivate someone towards!
Perhaps this practical joke was reinforced by the joker card (the thought of a 'joker' often conjures the idea of mischief and practical jokes)?

Still, it was enjoyable enough to hear groans and laughs from those new to this.

Once in a Computing lesson I added some joke comments into some PHP code.
After consulting staff for assistance with an issue with the program, I was asked to test run it and I was surprised to see that the comments were output in the console application!
Hearing chuckles, I quickly apologised saying that these were commented out and was expecting them to not be output.
Well, the positive reception of comic programmer jokes led me to consider incorporating my sense of humour into some of my applications.

Here it is, one of the most irritating applications that performs one purpose: to troll the user!
It presents to the user a beautifully decorated card in full ASCII glory.
The card displayed is self-explanatory, but regardless of the user's input, it always accuses the user of losing.
There is no way of winning this practical joke application.
