# CPP-Minor-Sub-projects
Welcome to my C++ pet project repository, which is part of my software development portfolio.

As part of learning C++, I have developed some independent projects that perform small tasks.

Here there are various small programs that are designed to be compiled, linked and then executed in a command line, which demonstrate various basic, intermediate and advanced skills.

The test operating systems used were Fedora Linux 35/36.
The recommended Linux kernel version is 5.19.14-200.
GNU GCC is used to compile on the test system.
The current recommended version is 12.2.1 20220819.
The tested system architecture is x86_64.

Please feel free to browse the subprojects and to read the commentary.
